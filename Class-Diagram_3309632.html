A user can browse, select, and interact with multiple travel packages, and a travel package can be associated with multiple users. It is a typical association where both classes can exist and function independently.</p><p><strong>User and TravelPackage (Dependency):</strong> In the context of booking a travel package, we can also identify a <strong>weak relationship</strong> between User and TravelPackage. The User class may depend on the TravelPackage class for booking purposes. However, this dependency is not explicitly shown in the class diagram provided since it is not part of the current sprint.</p><p><strong>TravelPackage and Flight: </strong>TravelPackage can include  <strong>Flights </strong>as part of its offering. The <strong>aggregation </strong>relationship signifies that the Travel Package is composed of Flights. Each Flight represents a part of the overall Travel Package. </p><p><strong>TravelPackage and Hotel: </strong>TravelPackage can include one or more <strong>Hotels </strong>as part of its offering. The <strong>aggregation </strong>relationship signifies that the Travel Package is composed of Hotels. Each Hotel represents a part of the overall Travel Package.</p><p><strong>Travel Package and Activity: </strong>TravelPackage can include one or more <strong>Activities </strong>as part of its offering. The <strong>aggregation </strong>relationship signifies that the Travel Package is composed of Activities. Each Hotel represents a part of the overall Travel Package.</p><p><strong>User and Booking: </strong>In the context of the travel booking system, the Booking and User classes have an <strong>association</strong> relationship rather than a dependency. The association represents the connection between the Booking and User classes, indicating that a Booking is associated with a specific User who made the booking.</p><p><strong>Booking and Travel Package:</strong> The relationship is an <strong>association</strong>, which represents that a Booking is associated with a specific TravelPackage. This association indicates that a Booking is made for a particular TravelPackage. <br/><strong>Booking</strong> and <strong>EmailService</strong>: A <strong>dependency</strong> relationship indicates that one class depends on another class for some functionality or resources. In this case, the Booking class depends on the EmailService class to send email notifications to customers. The dependency relationship indicates that the Booking class uses the services provided by the EmailService class to send email notifications.</p>
