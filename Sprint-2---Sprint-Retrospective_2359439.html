This indicates that the planning and estimation were accurate.</p></li><li><p>Our aim was to cover 2 Epics:</p><ul><li><p>Epic 2 -  Agent Management</p></li><li><p>Epic 3 - Booking Management</p></li></ul></li><li><p>This product necessitated a significant amount of product re-engineering. We implemented modifications to the database structure to enhance the product's reliability and reduce coupling. This work was carried out at the outset before commencing the development of Sprint 2's features. Thanks to meticulous planning and task allocation, the sprint proceeded in a streamlined manner without affecting the deliverables or their scheduled delivery timeline, thereby avoiding any additional tasks being added to the backlog.</p></li><li><p>Regular SCRUM meetings and Stand-up meetings after the lecture and on weekends played a significant role in helping us achieve our goal.</p></li><li><p>All the team-members were now familiar with the technology stack. This led to work being done independently and we were able to complete our assigned tasks accurately, on time.</p></li><li><p>Jira was instrumental in tracking and managing the project's progress. It allowed us to see who was working on what tasks and provided a comprehensive view of the project's overall progress.</p></li><li><p>The success of this sprint too, was due to strong leadership, mutual understanding among team members, willingness to learn new skills, and tolerance for mistakes.</p></li></ul><h2 id="Sprint2-SprintRetrospective-ChangesandGoalsForSprint3">Changes and Goals For Sprint 3</h2><ul><li><p>The team is content with each member's performance, as we are working according to our plan and have<br/>no backlogs to carry over to Sprint 3.</p></li><li><p>The most crucial improvement we need is to enhance code readability by incorporating comprehensive comments and JavaDoc documentation throughout the codebase. This will have a profound impact on code maintenance, facilitating a better understanding of the codebase by all team members.</p></li><li><p>Before the start of the next sprint, we have already started understanding the nuances of using a Payment Gateway and understanding the cases we have to handle while making payments using Credit Cards.</p></li><li><p>For the last sprint (Sprint 3), our goal is to integrate the previous features with the features that will be developed in the last sprint and have the complete working application.</p></li><li><p>We are working on Epic 2 -  Booking Management and continuing work on Epic 3 - Agent Management.</p></li><li><p>We have an estimation of 6 user stories, that will complete the development of the product.</p></li><li><p>An end-to-end testing will be completed at the end of the Sprint to make sure the application is working for end-user.</p></li></ul><p />
