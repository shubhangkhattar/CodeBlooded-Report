Consequently, our workload and schedule estimations were accurate.</p></li><li><p>Proper task allocation also aids us in reaching our goals effectively. An explicit distribution of tasks among team members before commencing work prevents conflicts from occurring.</p></li><li><p>Regular SCRUM meetings facilitated early and frequent communication among team members. During these meetings, team members could share any roadblocks they faced, allowing us to identify issues early on and resolve them before they escalated.</p></li><li><p>We stuck to the planned delivery dates to ensure the timely completion of tasks instead of deferring them to the next sprint.</p></li><li><p>The positivity and enthusiasm of the team members helped the sprint execution go well.<br/></p></li></ul><h3 id="SprintReview-Whatshouldwestopdoing?">What should we stop doing?</h3><ul><li><p>A few team members were late to SCRUM meetings. Avoiding this would have prevented other team<br/>members from being forced to wait, thus making the meetings more efficient.</p></li><li><p>Some team members had interdependency of work, so we need to plan the stories so that team members can work parallelly without having dependency and plan accordingly.</p></li><li><p>Avoid discussions in SCRUM meetings and keep them short.<br/></p></li></ul><h3 id="SprintReview-Whatcouldhavebeendonebetter?">What could have been done better?</h3><ul><li><p>During Sprint 1, we concentrated on developing the primary aspect of the project. To implement product features, we first decided to go with gradel dependency management but later we converted it to the maven dependency. We could have planned that before to avoid base code changes.</p></li><li><p>Documenting the difficulties and other development approaches would be a better way to share knowledge among the team members.</p></li><li><p>More accurate updates of task statuses on Jira would help keep all team members informed and better track project progress.<br/></p></li></ul><h3 id="SprintReview-Whatshouldwestartdoing?">What should we start doing?</h3><ul><li><p>It is important to report and document any issues that team members face in the scrum meeting only itself so that other team members can take a lookup.</p></li><li><p>Perform the integration testing of the system whenever a feature branch is merged with the main.</p></li></ul>
